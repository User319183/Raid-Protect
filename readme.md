Welcome to Raid-Protect!

Raid-Protect is a Discord bot to protect your server. This bot comes with a toxicity filter, anti-invites filter, anti-spam, logging, and auto-kick. Pretty much everything you need to maintain a clean server!

What do these filters do?

**Toxicity Filter:** The anti-toxicity! Block toxic words / phrases from your server. We will be working on making this much more stronger.

**Anti-invites:** Don't want people to send Discord server invites? Enable this filter and you can block people from advertising their server! We have made big adjustments to this filter.

**Anti-Spam** WIP (work in progress)

**Logging:** Want to log your members when they delete or edit a message? Enable this filter and set a log channel!

**Auto-kick:** Is there a mass raid with user-bots joining your server? Don't worry! Enable this feature so all members who join get instant kicked! You can change the code to ban them instead of kick as well.


This bot will be getting updates to be up-to-date.
