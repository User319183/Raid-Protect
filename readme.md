Welcome to Raid-Protect!

Raid-Protect is a Discord bot to protect your server. This bot comes with a toxicity filter, anti-invites filter, anti-spam, logging, and auto-kick. Pretty much everything you need to maintain a clean server!

What do these filters do?

**Toxicity Filter:** The anti-toxicity! Block toxic words / phrases from your server. We are currently working on this by improving this. Feel free to fork this repo and edit the code.

**Anti-invites:** Don't want people to send Discors server invites? Enable this filter and you can block people from advertising their server!

**Anti-Spam** Don't like the spam in your Discord server? Enabling this filter prevents spam. If the bot finds out a member has been spamming, the member will be kicked & DM'd saying they have been kicked.

**Logging:** Want to log your members? Enable this filter and create a channel called `logs` !

**Auto-kick:** Is there a mass raid with user-bots joining your server? Don't worry! Enable this feature so all members who join get instant kicked! You can change the code to ban them instead of kick as well.


This bot will be getting updates to be up-to-date.


**Next update Features:**

1. Implement slash commands

2. Add a way to whitelist channels from filters
